# Space Rescue Game

Welcome to Space Rescue: An immersive 3D interactive game where you are a Space Rescue pilot on a mission to rescue stranded settlers throughout the solar system. The game demos your first mission. You can use your mouse or WASD controls to guide the spacecraft. 

This was a project built for my final project at [Maker's Academy Software Development Boot Camp.](https://www.makers.tech) To run this you will need to first clone and start the [accompanying Rails API](https://github.com/mfolsom/space-rescue-api). This will allow you to register with any username you like and login with your credentials.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As the build tool for a faster and more efficient development experience.
- **TypeScript**: For adding static type definitions to enhance code quality and understandability.
- **BabylonJS**: A powerful, beautiful, simple, and open game and rendering engine to create stunning 3D experiences in the web browser.

## Features

- **Galactic Coordinate Navigation**: Utilizes a unique system to navigate the vast expanse of space.
- **Dynamic UI Elements**: Interactive elements that display the ship's direction based on real-time galactic coordinates.
- **Immersive 3D Graphics**: Leveraging BabylonJS to render high-quality 3D graphics for an engaging game experience.

## Getting Started
